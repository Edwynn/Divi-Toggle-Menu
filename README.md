# Divi-Toggle-Menu

The Divi Menu and the Fullwidth Menu modules started gaining more popularity among Divi users since the release of the Divi Theme Builder which allows creating headers using the Divi Builder.

Both of these menu modules provide quite a decent functionality for creating menus but currently are still lacking an important feature: they do not allow collapsing the mobile menu submenus.

This may be a serious UX issue especially with the complex menus having multi-level submenus each having many items which makes the mobile menu very long.

So, in this post I provide a solution for the issue. It allows to collapse the nested items and lets you choose whether to disable the parent links or keep them clickable on mobile devices.

Works for both the Menu Module and the Fullwidth Menu Module.
